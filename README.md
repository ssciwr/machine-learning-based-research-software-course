# Compact course: AI in research software

Is your research based on data? Do you use and/or train machine-learning models in your research? Then this course may be of interest to you!

This is a joint compact course held by Dr. Georg Schwesinger/Dr. Sebastian Zangerle (Research Data Unit), Peter Lippmann (Scientific AI group) and Dr. Inga Ulusoy (Scientific Software Center).

Context: The AI revolution is moving even more rapidly than the digital revolution and leads to the emergence of completely new tools and technologies that affect the scientific process. In this course, we will learn about data-based research software, tools and communities that are relevant in creating and sharing such software, and about best practices in data preparation, data sharing, training, sharing and using machine-learning models. Further, legal and ethical considerations will be discussed, as well as software security and possible pitfalls.

# Learning objectives
After the course participants will be able to
- Understand and follow best practices about preparing a dataset for training and testing
- Understand and follow best practices in training ML models
- Including appropriate tests in machine-learning based research software (MLBRS)
- Avoid negative impact from legal and security issues
- Know how to use appropriate checklist when publishing results that are based on ML approaches

# Prerequisites
Basic Python knowledge and knowledge about data processing, ML models and training of models is required.
